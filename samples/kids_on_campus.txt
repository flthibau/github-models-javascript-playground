SCHOOLCRAFT COLLEGE KIDS ON CAMPUS PROGRAMS
 PARTICIPATION WAIVER AND RELEASE OF LIABILITY
 ASSUMPTION OF RISK AND INDEMNITY AGREEMENT
 In consideration of the Minor Child being allowed to participate in Schoolcraft College’s Kids on Campus Programs, I the 
undersigned, acknowledge and agree as follows: 
1. I certify that I am the parent/guardian with legal 
responsibility and authority for the Minor Child.
 2. I understand the nature of Schoolcraft College’s Kids on 
Campus Programs is to provide educational experiences 
for minors and that the Minor Child may be involved in 
activities that include, but are not limited to: arts, crafts, 
science experiments, games, sporting activities (soccer, 
basketball, flag football and volleyball), use of culinary 
equipment, woodcraft tools, first aid training (CPR/AED and 
venipuncture), computers, ceramics, welding, firefighting 
equipment, and manufacturing equipment.
 3. I am familiar with and accept, on behalf of myself and the 
Minor Child, that the risks of injury to the Minor Child from 
the activities involved in Kids on Campus Programs are 
significant, including the potential for permanent disability 
and death, and while rules, equipment, and personal 
discipline may reduce these risks, the risks of serious injury 
and illness do exist.
 4. I have satisfied myself and warrant that the Minor Child is 
physically, emotionally, and mentally able to participate in 
the Kids on Campus Programs.
 5. I hereby RELEASE, WAIVE, DISCHARGE and COVENANT 
NOT TO SUE, SCHOOLCRAFT COLLEGE, ITS BOARD, BOARD 
MEMBERS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, STUDENTS, AGENTS 
OR REPRESENTATIVES and/or VOLUNTEERS from any 
and all liability, claims, demands, actions, and causes of 
action whatsoever arising out of or related to any loss, 
damage or injury, that may be sustained by the Minor Child 
WHETHER CAUSED BY THE NEGLIGENCE OF ANY BOARD 
MEMBER, OFFICER, EMPLOYEE, STUDENT, AGENT OR 
REPRESENTATIVE and/or VOLUNTEER of SCHOOLCRAFT 
COLLEGE, or otherwise, while participating in Schoolcraft

upon the premises where the Schoolcraft College’s Kids on 
Campus Programs are being conducted. 
8. I shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Schoolcraft 
College, its Board, Board Members, Officers, Employees, 
Students, Agents or Representatives and/or Volunteers 
against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, 
claims, actions, judgements, settlements, interest, awards, 
penalties, fines, costs, or expenses of whatever kind, 
including attorneys’ fees, fees, the costs of enforcing any 
right to indemnification under this Agreement, and the cost of 
pursuing any insurance providers, arising out of or resulting 
from any claim of a third party related to the Minor Child being 
on the Premises or participating in Schoolcraft College’s Kids 
on Campus Programs. 
9. In case of emergency, I give permission for emergency 
medical treatment of the Minor Child and for transportation 
to such treatment. I UNDERSTAND THAT SCHOOLCRAFT

 10. Photographs/Videos may be taken of the Minor Child during the 
Kids on Campus Programs. These photographs/videos may be 
used for future Kids on Campus Programs promotional materials.
 6. I VOLUNTARILY ASSUME FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY 
RISKS OF LOSS, DAMAGE OR PERSONAL INJURY, that may 
be sustained by me, or any loss or damage as a result 
of participating in Schoolcraft College’s Kids on Campus 
Programs. 
7. It is my express intent that this Agreement shall bind 
the members of mine and the Minor Child’s family, heirs, 
assigns and personal representative, and shall be deemed 
as a RELEASE, WAIVER, DISCHARGE and COVENANT NOT 
TO SUE SCHOOLCRAFT COLLEGE, ITS BOARD, BOARD

OR REPRESENTATIVES and/or VOLUNTEERS.
 11. This Agreement constitutes the sole and entire agreement

respect to the subject matter contained herein and supersedes 
all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, 
representations, and warranties, both written and oral, with

Agreement is held invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the validity, 
legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not 
in any way be affected or impaired thereby and such provision 
shall be ineffective only to the extent of such invalidity, illegality 
or unenforceability. This Release is binding on and shall inure 
to the benefit of Schoolcraft College, myself and the Minor

arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be governed 
by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
